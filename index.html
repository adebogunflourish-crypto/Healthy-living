          <p> Let us look at mindfulness and stress management.</p>
          <h3> What Is Mindfulness</h3>
        <p>Mindfulness is the practice of being present in the moment, paying attention to your thoughts, feelings, and sensations without judgment. It's about cultivating awareness and acceptance of the present moment, rather than getting caught up in thoughts of the past or worries about the future.</p>

           </ul>
          <h3> Impact Of Stress On Mental And Physical Health</h3>
          <p>Stress can have a significant impact on both mental and physical health.</p>

<h4>Mental Health Impacts</h4>
          <ul>
<li>Anxiety and depression: Chronic stress can contribute to the development of anxiety and depression.</li>
<li>Mood disorders: Stress can trigger mood swings, irritability, and emotional instability.</li>
<li> Cognitive impairment: Stress can affect attention, memory, and decision-making abilities.</li>            </ul>
<h4> Physical Health Impacts</h4>

<li> Digestive problems: Stress can cause stomach problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), acid reflux, and stomach ulcers.</li>
</ul>
     <h3>  Effect Of Mindfulnesson Stress Management </h3>  
          <ul>
            <li> Mindfulness practices like paying attention to the present helps us to control the repetitive, and non-productive thought that lead to stress. For instance when you don't get a feedback from an interview you went for, instead of having negative thoughts on the outcome of the interview, focus on the curr thing you ae doing, you can get your mind off the posibl outcome of the interview and focus on reading a book or doing something you love, that way you manage your stress.</li>
            <li> Open attitude is a mindful practice one can do. Open attitude gives one the ability to tolerate difficult situations and stops one from having negative thoughts. Let me give you a practical example, see yourself having a disagreement with you friend, intead of getting Def or Letting your emotions rule you, try to see from your friends point of view, ask questions to clarify their concerns, approach the conversation with curiosity and empathy, by doing this, you diffuse tension and find common ground.</li>
            <li> Reperceiving is a mindfulness practice that allows you to identify from thoughts, emotions and body sensations as they arise, and simply be with them instead of being controlled or defined by them. That way we know that the negative thoughts does not define who we are and we see thin for what it is.For instancewhen you are stuck in a traffic jam, and you are runnin late for work instead of getting angry or anxious, recognise that you are anxious or angr and accept it, think of the situationthat you are in as a blessing in  disguise, an opportunity to clear your head, and elax a little before starting your work, and you will notice pu will no longer be anxious, that way you will be able to manage your stress and get to work looking refreshed. </li>
            </ul>
